# YampaConvertTargetProgram

These programs can be tanslated to xml file with YampaConvert program(https://github.com/SqlabNR/YampaConvert).These are written by Haskell programming language.

# BallFalling.hs

This is the ball-bouncing program the ball fall free and bound on ground.the gravitational acceleration is -10 and ground's coefficient of restitution is 0.5

# BallFalling2.hs

This is the ball-bouncing program the ball fall free and bound on ground.the gravitational acceleration is -9.8 and ground's coefficient of restitution is 0.5

# BallFalling3.hs

This is the ball-bouncing program the ball fall free and bound on ground.the gravitational acceleration is -9.8 and ground's coefficient of restitution is 0.6

# Ha1Program.hs

This is moving-ball within frame program the ball move at a constant speed within a square connection four points (15,15),(15,-10),(-10,-10),(-10,15). A "edge" function is used to reflect on the wall. This program causes the error.

# Ha4Program.hs

This is moving-ball within frame program the ball move at a constant speed within a square connection four points (15,15),(15,-10),(-10,-10),(-10,15). Four "edge" functions are used to reflect on the wall. This program doesn't cause the error.


# Ha4Program2.hs

This is moving-ball within frame program the ball move at a constant speed within a square connection four points (15,15),(15,-10),(-10,-10),(-10,15). Four "edge" functions is used to reflect on the wall. This program causes the error unlike Ha4Program.hs.

# TempControl.hs

This is temp-control program the cooler is switched  "on" state and "off" state to keep the temperture 20 and 30. In "on" state, the temperture increases by 3.In "off" state, the temperture decreases by 5.

# 2Ha4Program1.hs

This is moving-ball within frame program the two ball move at a constant speed within a square connection four points (15,15),(15,-10),(-10,-10),(-10,15). when distance of two balls is small, collision event is detected and two balls switch speed. This program causes the error.


# 2Ha4Program2.hs

This is moving-ball within frame program the two ball move at a constant speed within a square connection four points (15,15),(15,-10),(-10,-10),(-10,15). when distance of two balls is small and both balls are in the frame, collision event is detected and two balls switch speed. This program doesn't cause the error.
